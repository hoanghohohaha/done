            <p><b>IT HAS SOME SERIOUS STORAGE CAPACITY.</b><br>
                    Your stomach at rest holds about 7 ounces of stomach acid and bile. However, it has the capacity to hold nearly a half-pound of food at a time if necessary. (The average capacity is about 32 ounces, or a quarter-gallon.) It normally takes from four to six hours to digest one meal, so this capacity can be important.</p><br>
            <p><b> IT'S A HORMONE-GENERATING MACHINE.</b><br>
                    Eating and digesting your food is most likely something you never have to think about. Yet your GI tract is home to a veritable orchestra of hormones stimulated by epithelial cells that line the stomach and small intestine. These hormones engage in a wide range of functions, including stimulating appetite, encouraging the secretion of enzymes and gastric acid, and reminding the gall bladder to contract and empty. These hormones directly enter the blood, and eventually affect the function of other parts of the digestive system, including the liver and pancreas, and even your brain.</p><br>
            <p><b>YOUR STOMACH IS ONE OF YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM'S FIRST LINES OF DEFENSE.</b><br>
                    Besides just digesting your food, the stomach helps protect your entire body. "The acidity in our stomach helps to sterilize whatever you're eating. It kills off bacteria and potential food toxins," says Ganjhu. Your gastrointestinal tract also has patches of lymphoid defense cells it sends out when something makes it through the stomach, such as a virus or bacterial infection.  </p><br>
